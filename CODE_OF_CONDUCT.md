# Tutera Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct applies to all projects in the Tutera organization and all spaces where community members interact (GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, and any official chat or collaboration channels).

Our goal is to foster a **welcoming, inclusive, and productive** environment for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing appreciation for others’ time and effort

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Harassment, abuse, or discrimination in any form
- Public or private harassment, including intrusive or unwelcome attention
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Publishing others’ private information (doxxing), such as physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Deliberate misgendering or use of rejected names
- Any conduct that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Responsibilities of Maintainers

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and may temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces. Examples include:

- Using an official project email address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as a designated representative at an online or offline event

## Reporting

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, or have any other concerns, you are encouraged to report it to the maintainers of the affected repository or to the Tutera organization maintainers.

When reporting, please include:

- Your contact information (if you are comfortable sharing it)
- Names or usernames of the individuals involved
- When and where the incident occurred
- A description of what happened
- Any additional context that might help us understand the situation

Reports will be handled as confidentially as reasonably possible. Information may be shared with others on a strict need-to-know basis in order to investigate and resolve the issue.

## Enforcement

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other maintainers of the project and/or the organization.

If you are unsure whether something might violate this Code of Conduct, err on the side of kindness and respect, or ask a maintainer for guidance.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is inspired by and adapted from widely used open-source codes of conduct such as the Contributor Covenant and other industry-standard documents.
